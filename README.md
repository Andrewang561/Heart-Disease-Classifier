# Heart Disease Classifier

I developed a classification model in R that is capable of diagnosing patients with heart disease based on their blood pressure and cholesterol levels. This was done by training the model using the K-nearest neighbour algorithm, which classifies new data based on previous data with similar attributes. This project demonstrates skills in data science as various techniques were applied such as cross-validation and data wrangling to ensure the highest possible accuracy the model could obtain with the given constraints.
